        <li>
          In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over
          medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato
          paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel
          seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons
          parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring
          occasionally.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna
          noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse
          with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg,
          remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>
          To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a
          9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce.
          Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third
          of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over
          mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers,
          and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with
          foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or
          make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an
          additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.
